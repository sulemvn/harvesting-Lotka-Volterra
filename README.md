# Lotka-Volterra Harvesting Impact Analysis

## Overview
This project examines the effects of harvesting on the Lotka-Volterra model, which describes prey-predator dynamics. It employs numerical methods like Euler, Heun, and Runge-Kutta for simulation.

## Objectives
- To understand how harvesting impacts prey-predator relationships.
- To simulate these effects using various numerical methods.

## Methodology
The study uses Matlab for simulations, applying different harvesting rates to observe changes in population dynamics.

## Key Findings
- Harvesting rates significantly influence population behaviors.
- The results offer insights into ecological system modeling and sustainability.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable perspectives on environmental management and the complexities of ecological systems.
